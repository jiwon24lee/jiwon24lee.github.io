      Outside of research, I enjoy playing the electric guitar and listening to music rooted in band-style sound.
      I often rehearse and play cover songs with old bandmates from university, and we've had some great times practicing together in band practice rooms.
      When I'm alone, I usually pick a song to practice on my own.
      Being a big fan of rock and heavy metal, my choices tend to be technically demanding and often take months to master.
      But, when I finally get through them, it's always a very rewarding experience.
      On top of that, I've also been exploring a broader range of music — from Korean indie bands like <em>Life and Time</em> and various genres, such as fusion and blues artists — and currently, I'm working on <em>Lucretia</em> by <em>Megadeth</em>.
      This variety helps me stay inspired and continuously expand my musical vocabulary.
